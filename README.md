# LearnDBT

This repository is a learning project focused on DBT (Data Build Tool) using the `dvdrental` dataset provided by PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL is run on Docker to create a reproducible development environment.

## Project Overview

Explore various analyses using the `dvdrental` dataset to answer key business questions. Results are visualized with graphs and SQL queries.
